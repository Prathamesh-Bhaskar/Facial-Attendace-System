# Siamese Facial Recognition

## Description

This project is aimed at building a Siamese Neural Network for facial recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The Siamese architecture is particularly useful for tasks involving verification or identification of objects that don't fall into distinct categories. In this case, we're focusing on facial recognition, where we want to determine whether two facial images belong to the same person or not.

## Features

- Collect positive and negative image pairs for training
- Implement a Siamese Neural Network for learning embeddings
- Train the model to recognize similarities between facial images
- Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset
- Provide utilities to capture images from a webcam for dataset collection

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation
